            <p> Jin is one of the three main characters in the show Samurai Champloo. He is accompanied by Mugen and Fuu as they search for "the samurai who smells of sunflowers."  <br/>
            <br/>                
                
            Jin had walked into the diner in which Mugen and Fuu were in. Mugen had dashed to Jin with his sword drawn. Jin placed his hand on his sword, scanned the room, and drew his sword and begun to fight against ang with Mugen.<br/>
            <br/>

            During the fight between Jin and Mugen, the other men in the room who had previously been fighting Mugen, had for the most part been defeated with many of them proceeding to flee. It wasn't until of the men who had been beaten by Mugen at the begnining returns for revenge. It is at this moment that Jin and Mugen both stopped in their tracks.
