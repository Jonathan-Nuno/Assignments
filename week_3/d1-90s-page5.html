            <p> The show Samurai Champloo used instrumental hip hop, downtempo hip hop, j-pop and electronica. The most well known musical artist from the show is Nujabes. <br/>
            <br/>                
                
            Nujabes is one of, if no the most memorable artist from Samurai Champloo's soundtrack. The beats and pacing of the songs along with the animation/art style of the show had a flow like no other. Not only was Samurai Champloo's soundtrack smooth, it was able to enchance the feelings being portrayed in each episode.<br/>
