            <p> Fuu is one of the three main characters in the show Samurai Champloo. She is accompanied by Jin and Mugen as they search for "the samurai who smells of sunflowers."  <br/>
            <br/>                
                
            Fuu first met Mugen in the diner she was working in when a couple of men were hassling her for free food. After Mugen has begun fighting with the men, Jin later walked in to the diner only to be met by Mugen's sword. They began to fight as one of the men returned seeking revenge. At this point, Fuu fled the diner with the owners as it begun to burn down.<br/>
            <br/>

            Jin and Mugen were arrested by the local officals shortly after. Fuu was able to rescue Jin and Mugen moments before they were executed by the local officials. As a way to pay Fuu back, Jin and Mugen swore to accompany Fuu on any task she would like. It was at this point Fuu requested Jin and Mugen help her find the samurai who smells of sunflowers.
