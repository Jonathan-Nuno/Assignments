            <p> Mugen is one of the three main characters in the show Samurai Champloo. He is accompanied by Jin and Fuu as they search for "the samurai who smells of sunflowers." Mugen first met Fuu in the small family diner she was working for. <br/>
            <br/>                
                
            Mugen offered protection to Fuu from the men she was serving as they were threatening her. He asked Fuu to compensate him with dumplings and he would take care of all the mean in the dinner. <br/>
            <br/>

            After Mugen had beat some of the men in the diner, he dashed to the front door and slashed with his blade with the intent to kill. On the other side of the door was Jin who for the first time is meeting Mugen and begins to draw his sword to defend himself.
